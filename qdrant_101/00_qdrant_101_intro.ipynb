    "Vector databases are a type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. In traditional [OLTP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/oltp) and [OLAP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/olap) databases (as seen in the image above), data is organized in rows and columns, and queries are performed based on the values in those columns. However, in certain applications including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, data is often represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, and these vectors, plus an id and a payload, are the elements we store in a vector database like Qdrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector in this context is a mathematical representation of an object or data point, where each element of the vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute of the object. For example, in an image recognition system, a vector could represent an image, with each element of the vector representing a pixel value or a descriptor/characteristic of that pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are optimized for **storing** and **querying** these high-dimensional vectors efficiently, often using specialized data structures and indexing techniques such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) -- which is used to implement Approximate Nearest Neighbors -- and Product Quantization, among others. These databases enable fast similarity and semantic search while allowing users to find vectors that are the closest to a given query vector based on some distance metric. The most commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, and Dot Product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what vector databases are, and how they are structurally different than other databases, let's go over why they are important."

    "- [Collections](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/collections/): A collection is a named set of points (vectors with a payload) among which you can search. Vectors within the same collection can have different dimensionalities and be compared by a single metric.\n",
    "- [Distance Metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space): These are used to measure similarities among vectors and they must be selected at the same time you are creating a collection. The choice of metric depends on the way the vectors were obtained and, in particular, on the neural network that will be used to encode new queries.\n",
    "- [Points](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/points/): The points are the central entity that Qdrant operates with and they consist of a vector and an optional id and payload.\n",
    "    - id: a unique identifier for your vectors.\n",
    "    - Vector: a high-dimensional representation of data, for example, an image, a sound, a document, a video, etc.\n",
    "    - [Payload](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/payload/): A payload is a JSON object with additional data you can add to a vector.\n",
    "- [Storage](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/storage/): Qdrant can use one of two options for storage, **In-memory** storage (Stores all vectors in RAM, has the highest speed since disk access is required only for persistence), or **Memmap** storage, (creates a virtual address space associated with the file on disk).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the same way in which we can create many tables in an OLTP or an OLAP database, we can create many collections in a vector database like Qdrant using one of its clients. The key difference to note is that when we create a collection in Qdrant, we need to specify the width of the collection (i.e. the length of the vector or amount of dimensions) beforehand with the parameter `size=...`, as well as the distance metric with the parameter `distance=...` (which can be changed later on).\n",

Think of it like a ruler that tells you how far apart two points are, but instead of measuring distance, it measures how similar two things are. It's often used with text to compare how similar two documents or sentences are to each other. The output of the cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the two things are completely dissimilar, and 1 means the two things are exactly the same. It's a straightforward and effective way to compare two things!\n",
    "- [**Dot Product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) - The dot product similarity metric is another way of measuring how similar two things are, like cosine similarity. It's often used in machine learning and data science when working with numbers. The dot product similarity is calculated by multiplying the values in two sets of numbers, and then adding up those products. The higher the sum, the more similar the two sets of numbers are. So, it's like a scale that tells you how closely two sets of numbers match each other.\n",
    "- [**Euclidean Distance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) - Euclidean distance is a way to measure the distance between two points in space, similar to how we measure the distance between two places on a map. It's calculated by finding the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two points' coordinates. This distance metric is commonly used in machine learning to measure how similar or dissimilar two data points are or, in other words, to understand how far apart they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create our first collection and have the vectors be of size 100 with a distance set to **Cosine Similarity**. Please note that, at the time of writing, Qdrant only supports cosine similarity, dot product and euclidean distance for its distance metrics."

    "A recommendation system is a technology that suggests items or content to users based on their preferences, interests, or past behavior. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who can recommend movies, books, music, or products that you might enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most widely-used form, recommendation systems work by analyzing a large amount of data about you and other users. The system looks at your previous choices, such as movies you've watched, products you've bought, or articles you've read, and it then compares this information with data from other people who have similar tastes or interests. By finding patterns and similarities, the system can predict what you might like and show it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are used in various online platforms, such as streaming services like Netflix, e-commerce websites like Amazon, social media platforms like Facebook, and even music apps like Spotify. They aim to personalize your experience, save you time searching for things you might like, or introduce you to new and relevant content that you may not have discovered otherwise.\n",

    "In a nutshell, a recommendation system is a smart tool that helps you discover new things you'll probably enjoy based on your preferences and the experiences of others.\n",

    "The method is straightforward to implement via the `client.recommend()` method, and it provides enough flexibility that the logic on how the feedback gets capture can rest in the hands of the developers of your organization's platform. So, what do you need to keep in mind when making recommendations with Qdrant?\n",
