The visual evidence further supports these advantages, showcasing substantial efficiency improvements without sacrificing accuracy, illustrating why Binary Quantization is a significant enhancement for OpenAI embeddings in practical applications.

### Experiment Setup: OpenAI Embeddings in Focus

In a pioneering exploration aimed at understanding the effects of Binary Quantization on search efficiency and accuracy, the experiment zeroes in on the utilization of OpenAI's state-of-the-art text-embedding models. These models are celebrated for their exceptional ability to grasp subtle linguistic features and semantic connections, forming the crux of the analysis. This investigation promises to delve into how Qdrant's Binary Quantization feature can potentially amplify the models' performance.

#### Dataset

The experiment harnesses a significant subset of data, specifically 100K random samples from the expansive [OpenAI 1M dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KShivendu/dbpedia-entities-openai-1M). Among these, 100 records are selected randomly to act as queries. The embedded representations derived from these queries embark on a search for their nearest neighbors within the dataset, establishing the experimental groundwork.

#### Experiment Parameters: Oversampling, Rescoring, and Search Limits

The experimentation unfolds through a meticulous parameter sweep concerning oversampling, rescoring, and search limits. This approach is instrumental in determining their distinct impacts on the precision and swiftness of query searches.

- **Search Limits** dictates the breadth of the search, detailing how many top results to consider in the findings. Various thresholds of this parameter were tested to gauge its impact on the balance between search depth and operational efficiency under the influence of Binary Quantization.

The well-orchestrated experimental design shines a light on the intricate interaction between Binary Quantization and the sophisticated embeddings from OpenAI's repertoire. By adeptly manipulating and evaluating the outcomes under a variety of conditions, the experiment aims to present valuable perspectives. These insights aspire to empower users to fully leverage the capabilities of Qdrant in tandem with OpenAI's embeddings, tailored to meet a diverse array of application necessities.

## Results: Binary Quantization's Impact on OpenAI Embeddings

In the realm of searching and matching OpenAI embeddings, rescoring emerges as a pivotal refinement step that substantially enhances accuracy. This section delves into the comparative analysis of accuracy variations when rescoring is toggled between enabled and disabled states across diverse model configurations and search thresholds.

### Rescoring

The graphical representation provided underscores the tangible benefits of enabling rescoring across different models and dimension configurations. Key insights drawn from this analysis include:

1. **Significant Accuracy Improvement with Rescoring**:
   The data showcases a uniform trend where enabling rescoring invariably boosts accuracy scores across varying models, dimensions, and search limits. This trend highlights the integral role of rescoring as a second layer of precision, refining initial search results to yield higher accuracy.

2. **Model and Dimension Specific Observations**:
   - The impact of rescoring is particularly pronounced in the `text-embedding-3-large` model at 3072 dimensions, where accuracy sees a dramatic uplift from circa 76-77% (without rescoring) to an impressive 97-99% (with rescoring). This implies that for high dimensional data, rescoring is not just beneficial but potentially transformative in achieving accuracy.
   - In contrast, for smaller models like `text-embedding-3-small` with 512 dimensions, although rescoring still significantly boosts accuracy (from 53-55% to 71-91%), the effect is more nuanced. Here, the benefits of increasing oversampling (adding more binary codes) are more apparent with rescoring, albeit with diminishing returns in lower dimension spaces. This suggests a complex interplay between model dimensionality, oversampling, and the efficacy of rescoring.
   
3. **Influence of Search Limit**:
   Consistency in performance gains across various search limits underscores rescoring's robustness as an accuracy enhancer. This observation indicates that the advantage of rescoring in refining search results is not constrained by the initial number of top results considered, highlighting its universal applicability irrespective of the specific search scope.

The overarching conclusion from this analysis is that rescoring is a critical tool for enhancing search accuracy in applications leveraging OpenAI embeddings. Its consistent ability to refine initial search results makes it indispensable in scenarios where precision is crucial. Its effectiveness across a spectrum of model sizes and dimensions, and its relative insensitivity to changes in search limit, establish rescoring as a universally beneficial tactic in optimizing search outcomes.

### Dataset Combinations

In this section, we are defining a list of dictionaries, each representing a specific configuration for text embedding models. These configurations vary in two main aspects: the model name and the dimensions of the embeddings.

- `model_name`: This key specifies the model used for text embedding. There are two models distinguished here, "text-embedding-3-large" and "text-embedding-3-small". These names suggest variations in model size or capacity, which could impact their performance, with "large" presumably offering more detailed embeddings at the cost of increased computational resources.
  
- `dimensions`: This key indicates the dimensionality of the embeddings produced by each model. The dimensions range from 512 to 3072. Higher-dimensional embeddings can capture more information and nuanced relationships between text inputs but also require more memory and computational power to process.

This setup implies an exploration of how varying the model type and embedding size affects the performance or suitability of these embeddings for a particular application, such as information retrieval, document similarity, or other natural language processing tasks. By listing combinations of model names and dimensions, this section sets the foundation for experiments or analyses that would compare these configurations on specific criteria, such as accuracy, speed, or resource consumption.

```python
dataset_combinations = [
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-large",
        "dimensions": 3072,
    },
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-large",
        "dimensions": 1024,
    },
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-large",
        "dimensions": 1536,
    },
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "dimensions": 512,
    },
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "dimensions": 1024,
    },
    {
        "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "dimensions": 1536,
    },
]
```

### Evaluating Model Performance Across Different Conditions

The blog segment focuses on the evaluation of model performance, particularly examining the impact of various dimensions, oversampling rates, and rescore conditions on the accuracy of text embedding models. The analysis covers a range of dimensions (3072, 1024, 1536, and 512) across different model specifications, namely "text-embedding-3-large" and "text-embedding-3-small".

#### Exploring the Impact of Oversampling and Rescoring
Through the analysis, it becomes evident that both oversampling and rescoring have profound effects on model accuracy. Oversampling rates and rescoring conditions are meticulously tested across different limit thresholds (10, 20, 50, and 100), and the outcomes are quantitatively captured in a structured manner. This procedure entails computing the average accuracy after excluding certain limit values (1 and 5) to ensure the relevance of the data to more practical retrieval scenarios.

#### Insights from Model "text-embedding-3-large" with Various Dimensions
For the "large" model variant across three different dimensions, the increase in dimensions consistently shows a direct correlation with improved accuracy across almost all tested scenarios. Specifically, with higher oversampling rates and when rescoring is applied, the model achieves remarkable accuracy improvements, illustrating the efficacy of these strategies in enhancing model performance. For instance, in the dimension of 3072, accuracy levels reach as high as 0.9966 under certain conditions, indicating a significant enhancement compared to lower dimensions.

#### Performance Analysis of "text-embedding-3-small" Model
Conversely, when analyzing the "small" variant of the model, the performance trends reveal insightful patterns. Here, even at lower dimensions such as 512, the model benefits from oversampling and rescoring, demonstrating notable accuracy improvements. For example, at a dimension of 1024 and under specific conditions, the model's accuracy can soar up to 0.9677, underscoring the critical role of optimizing these parameters even in smaller-scale models.

#### The Significance of Dimensionality and Model Configuration
Across both model variants (large and small), it's apparent that dimensionality plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of the text embedding processes. Higher dimensions generally contribute to more accurate models, given that the complexity of the embedded textual information can be more comprehensively captured. However, it's crucial to balance dimensionality with computational efficiency, as higher dimensions may incur more significant computational costs.

In conclusion, this analysis reveals the intricate relationships between model dimensions, oversampling, and rescoring in optimizing text embedding models' accuracy. It underscores the necessity of fine-tuning models based on specific requirements and constraints to achieve the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

```python
for combination in dataset_combinations:
    model_name = combination["model_name"]
    dimensions = combination["dimensions"]
    print(f"Model: {model_name}, dimensions: {dimensions}")
    results = pd.read_json(f"../results/results-{model_name}-{dimensions}.json", lines=True)
    average_accuracy = results[results["limit"] != 1]
    average_accuracy = average_accuracy[average_accuracy["limit"] != 5]
    average_accuracy = average_accuracy.groupby(["oversampling", "rescore", "limit"])[
        "accuracy"
    ].mean()
    average_accuracy = average_accuracy.reset_index()
    acc = average_accuracy.pivot(
        index="limit", columns=["oversampling", "rescore"], values="accuracy"
    )
    print(acc)
```
