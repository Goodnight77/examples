## Introduction

Binary quantization is a technique used to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of deep learning models. This project focuses on applying binary quantization to OpenAI models to improve their efficiency.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/qdrant/examples.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd binary-quantization-openai`
3. Install the required packages: `poetry install`

## Usage

To use the binary quantization techniques on an OpenAI embedding, follow these steps:

1. Load the created embedding into Qdrant
2. Apply binary quantization to the collection
3. Evaluate the performance of the quantized model
